Chess 99
--------

This is intended to be a translation of the chesslib library
(guidanoli/chess @ Github) to ANSI C or C99.

This will be a great challenge since much of the functionalities
were implemented using C++ features such as classes, operator
overloading and much of the standard library data structures.

At the same time, much learning will come into play into this
exciting adventure.
